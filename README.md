To begin with, one of the main issues with NFTs is the lack of enough utility in their nature. I mean in most cases utility of NFTs is bounded to DAO behind it. Our first suggestion is NFTs with passive income. The second is considering Trader's Fee alongside with Creator’s Fee.

  

1. Basically, most NFT collections like PFP NFT values are dependend on DAOs that created them, and buying and having NFT is not profitable for its owner. I propose a set of NFT collections that can make money using smart contracts.

  

	For instance, I have already implemented a collection named Hafiz Omens.

  

	Hafiz is the greatest Iranian poet whose poems are translated into many languages. In Persian-speaking countries, there is a tradition of fortune tellings using his poems (there is also a logical reason behind this tradition).

  

	I created an NFT collection using a small portion of Hafiz omens which can be traded as a regular NFT on the Opensea marketplace(collection address: [link](https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/hafizfaal-x4tr6ve9ng)). Besides, I launched a website at [hafiz-faal](https://hafiz-faal-evmos.netlify.app/) that you can pay 0.01Eth and make a wish. Smart contract splits this value and sends 90% to the NFT owner and keeps 10% for other purposes that may DAO decide (yes, we have a DAO that can provide similar utilities like other collections)

  

	This is not the only collection that could have such potential. Another example would be Picasso’s paintings. We could put all of the paintings in a collection and run an exhibition on metaverse platforms and sell tickets to visitors and split the money like so-called.

  

2. Like the creator's fee we can have a trader's fee. For this purpose, we can store the last 3 owners of every NFT, and instead of like 5% creator’s fee, take a 2% creator’s fee and spread 3% among the last 3 owners.


If we mint enough and various collections (like in poetry, paintings, music, sculptures, and even medicine, etc) then we will be able to launch a rich metaverse that users can have an immersive experience of ancient ages' artworks and NFT owners are going to have passive income. I am thrilled to make such a metaverse using Cosmos ecosystem.
